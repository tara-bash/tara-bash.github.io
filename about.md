## This Blog
This Blog is my space to document what I’ve learned along the way. From image classification to fingerprint recognition and model interpretability, I’m exploring how to build real-world AI systems using fastai’s practical, top-down approach.

Each post dives into a specific concept or project, with code walkthroughs and reflections on what worked, what didn’t, and how I improved. If you're also learning or just curious about applied AI, I hope these entries are useful.

More posts coming soon as I continue learning!
